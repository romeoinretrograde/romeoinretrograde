Hi! My name is Danilo, also known as @romeoinretrograde. Nice to meet you! :blush:

I'm currently doing some independent-studying to become a Full Stack Developper, and will start a three-months course this October. 

I know some basics of: 
- HTML; 
- CSS; 
- Ruby 
- and Python, but am always eager to learn more! 

Outside of coding, music is one of my biggest interests, as I am also a songwriter and singer.
